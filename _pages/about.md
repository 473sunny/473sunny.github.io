Research Interests
======
Currently, I am conducting research on urban carbon emissions, focusing on the spatial and temporal characteristics of carbon emissions from transportation trips in megacities and the mechanisms that influence them. I am using structural equation modeling (SEM) to explore the complex relationship between the built environment and travel behavior.

I hope to continue working in this field in my future academic career. This includes using mathematical modeling methods, ArcGIS spatial analysis techniques, qualitative analysis methods, and other approaches to measure the spatial differences and distribution characteristics of carbon emissions in different cities and regions. I aim to establish a built environment indicator system for urban carbon emissions and analyze its impact on residents' carbon emissions. The goal is to explore the role of the mechanism of carbon emissions in megacities.

Building upon this, I plan to propose corresponding planning strategies and policy recommendations.


**Please feel free to email me to discuss potential research collaborations.**
